# Interviewer AI Templates

This folder provides JSON templates for documentary-style interview planning.

Files:
- project_brief.json: project scope, goals, themes, constraints

How to use:

2) Complete subject_profile.json with research and pre-interview notes.
3) Use question_bank.json to populate interview_guide.json.
4) During production, add notes to interview_guide.json as you learn more.
