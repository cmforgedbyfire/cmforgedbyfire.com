# Forged By Fire QR Studio

Standalone Windows-ready QR generator for the Forged By Fire brand. Drop any URL, tweak the colors, add the glow, and download a PNG you can print on cards, packaging, or embed in apps.

## Usage

1. Open `qr-tool/index.html` in any modern browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox) on Windows.
2. Choose a master destination from the dropdown or select “Custom URL” and paste your own link.
3. Adjust size, color, error correction, and label text. Flip on the “Add flare” toggle for a glow effect.
4. Click “Download PNG” to save `forged-qrcode.png`.
5. Use the “Copy URL” button to grab the bound address for quick sharing.

## Notes

- The generator uses `qrcode.js` from CDN so it stays lightweight.
- Keep the file inside the repo so you can rebuild or archive versions alongside your other projects.
